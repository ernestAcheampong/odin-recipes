Overview
Congratulations to myself! This is the first step in my journey towards my learning career in software development. There are many paths that I can take in this field and this unit is the foundation for all of them. Every beginner must atleast master HTML and CSS, as well as learn how to program browsers, servers, and databases. This is another project I'm working on and will be updating as a learn with <strong>microverse</strong>.
This project focuses on HTML for now. It's simply a food recipes containing link to recipes and images of the recipe. I will be updating it with CSS as time goes on. I'm learning Git, which is the most popular version control system. Git integrates with GitHub.com, a site for developers (as well as beginners) to host and share their code. We will deploy our first website using GitHub Pages.
